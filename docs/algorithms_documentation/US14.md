## 💡 Graph Theory Concepts

### 🚆 Eulerian Route (Path/Circuit)

The railway maintenance problem is a direct application of Euler's work on graph theory from 1736. An Eulerian route traverses every edge in a graph exactly once – precisely what's needed for efficient maintenance coverage.

#### 📚 Fundamental Definitions

- **🔄 Eulerian Circuit**: A closed path that visits every edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex
- **➡️ Eulerian Path**: A path that visits every edge exactly once, but does not necessarily return to the starting vertex.
- **🔢 Degree of a vertex**: The number of edges connected to that vertex

#### 🧮 Mathematical/Graph Conditions for Undirected Graph

1. **🟢 Eulerian Circuit Exists If and Only If:**
   - The graph is connected (excluding isolated vertices)
   - Every vertex has an even degree
   - _Physical meaning_: At every station, trains must enter and exit the same number of times

2. **🟡 Eulerian Path Exists If and Only If:**
   - The graph is connected (excluding isolated vertices)
   - Exactly two vertices have odd degree (these become start and end points)
   - All other vertices have even degree
   - The path must start and end at odd-degree vertices
   - _Physical meaning_: The maintenance route must begin and end at different stations

3. **🔴 No Eulerian Route Possible When:**
   - More than two vertices have odd degree
   - The graph contains disconnected components with edges
   - _Physical meaning_: Some railway segments would need to be traversed multiple times

#### 🛠️ Practical Implications

The existence of these mathematical conditions directly determines whether a single-pass maintenance route is possible, and which stations can serve as valid starting points.

## 🔬 Implemented Algorithm: Fleury's Algorithm

To find the maintenance route, **Fleury's Algorithm** has been implemented, a classic approach for determining an Eulerian path or circuit in a graph. This algorithm is particularly suitable because it handles graphs representing railway networks well, where connectivity and passing "once and only once" through each line are crucial.

### **📋 Step-by-Step: Fleury's Algorithm (Implemented)**

The implementation of Fleury's algorithm follows these steps:


#### 1️⃣ **Preprocessing & Subgraph Construction** (`buildRelevantGraphAndDegrees()`)
- Iterates through all stations and lines from `RailwayDataLoader`.
- Builds a subgraph (`relevantAdj`) with only the relevant lines (all or just electrified, per user choice).
- For each bidirectional line, adds two directed edges (`u → v` and `v → u`) with a unique `edgeId` (e.g., `stationA-stationB`) to ensure each physical line is only traversed once.
- Calculates the degree of each vertex (`degrees`) and identifies relevant nodes.


#### 2️⃣ **Eulerian Condition Check** (`isRelevantSubgraphConnected() e analyzeEulerianConditions()`)
- **Connectivity:** Uses DFS to verify if the subgraph is connected. If not, no Eulerian route is possible.
- **Vertex Degrees:** Counts vertices with odd degree:
   - `0` odd-degree: Eulerian circuit possible.
   - `2` odd-degree: Eulerian path possible (must start/end at these).
   - Any other: No Eulerian route possible.


#### 3️⃣ **Valid Start Stations** (`getPotentialStartStations()`)
- Determines possible starting stations based on Eulerian conditions:
   - **Circuit:** Any relevant station.
   - **Path:** Only the two odd-degree stations.
   - **None:** Returns an empty list.


#### 4️⃣ **Route Construction** (`findMaintenanceRoute()`)
- Initializes the route (`path`) from the chosen start.
- Tracks traversed lines with `usedEdges` (by `edgeId`).
- While there are edges to traverse from the current node:
   - **Edge Selection:** For each adjacent edge:
      - Skips if already used.
      - **Fleury's Rule:** Prefers non-bridge edges (uses `isEdgeBridge` to check).
      - If all are bridges, picks the first unused edge.
   - **Traverse Edge:**
      - Adds destination to `path`.
      - Marks `edgeId` as used.
      - Removes both directions (`u → v` and `v → u`) from the temp graph.
      - Continues from the new node.
- Stops when no more edges remain.


```java
private void fleuryDFS(int current, Map<Integer, List<EulerEdge>> adj, Map<String, Boolean> usedEdges, List<Integer> path) {
    List<EulerEdge> edges = adj.get(current);
    while (edges != null && !edges.isEmpty()) {
        EulerEdge chosen = null;
        // Choose a non-bridge edge if possible
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.size(); i++) {
            EulerEdge e = edges.get(i);
            if (!usedEdges.getOrDefault(e.edgeId, false)) {
                if (edges.size() == 1 || !isEdgeBridge(current, e.to, adj, usedEdges, e.edgeId)) {
                    chosen = e;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        if (chosen == null) break; // No more available edges

        // Mark the edge as used
        usedEdges.put(chosen.edgeId, true);

        // Remove the edge from both sides
        removeEdge(current, chosen.to, chosen.edgeId, adj);
        removeEdge(chosen.to, current, chosen.edgeId, adj);

        fleuryDFS(chosen.to, adj, usedEdges, path);
    }
    path.add(0, current);
}
```


#### 🛠️ Auxiliaries for Fleury's Algorithm:

- **`removeEdge(from, to, edgeId, adj)`**: This function removes a specific edge from the adjacency list representation of the graph. It ensures that both directions of the bidirectional edge are removed when traversing.

```java
private void removeEdge(int from, int to, String edgeId, Map<Integer, List<EulerEdge>> adj) {
   List<EulerEdge> list = adj.get(from);
   if (list != null) {
      for (Iterator<EulerEdge> it = list.iterator(); it.hasNext(); ) {
         EulerEdge e = it.next();
         if (e.to == to && e.edgeId.equals(edgeId)) {
            it.remove();
            break;
         }
      }
   }
}
```

-   **`isEdgeBridge(u, v, edgeId, adj)`**: This function determines if the edge between `u` and `v` (identified by `edgeId`) is a bridge. To do this, it temporarily removes the edges `u -> v` and `v -> u` from the graph, performs a DFS to count reachable nodes from `u`, and compares it with the number of reachable nodes before removal. If the number of reachable nodes decreases, it means the edge was a bridge. The edges are then restored.

```java
private boolean isEdgeBridge(int u, int v, Map<Integer, List<EulerEdge>> adj, Map<String, Boolean> usedEdges, String edgeId) {
    int before = dfsCount(u, new HashSet<>(), adj, usedEdges);
    // Temporarily remove the edges u-v and v-u
    removeEdge(u, v, edgeId, adj);
    removeEdge(v, u, edgeId, adj);
    int after = dfsCount(u, new HashSet<>(), adj, usedEdges);
    // Restore the edge
    adj.get(u).add(new EulerEdge(u, v, true));
    adj.get(v).add(new EulerEdge(v, u, true));
    return after < before;
}
```
  
- **`dfsCount(u, visited, adj, usedEdges)`**: An auxiliary DFS function that counts the number of reachable vertices from a given starting node `u`, ignoring edges that have already been used.

```java
private int dfsCount(int current, Set<Integer> visited, Map<Integer, List<EulerEdge>> adj, Map<String, Boolean> usedEdges) {
   visited.add(current);
   int count = 1;
   List<EulerEdge> edges = adj.get(current);
   if (edges != null) {
      for (EulerEdge e : edges) {
         if (!usedEdges.getOrDefault(e.edgeId, false) && !visited.contains(e.to)) {
            count += dfsCount(e.to, visited, adj, usedEdges);
         }
      }
   }
   return count;
}
```


#### 🧠 Why It Works:

- The algorithm only constructs a route if the graph meets the strict mathematical conditions for an Eulerian path or circuit (i.e., the graph is connected and the vertex degrees are appropriate).
- By always avoiding bridges (edges whose removal would disconnect the graph) except when necessary, Fleury's algorithm ensures that the traversal does not prematurely isolate parts of the network, guaranteeing that all lines can be covered without repetition.
- Each line is marked as used immediately after being traversed, preventing any edge from being visited more than once and ensuring the "once and only once" requirement.
- The use of DFS for both connectivity and bridge checks ensures that the route remains valid at every step of the construction.
- As a result, the algorithm always finds a valid Eulerian path or circuit if one exists, and only terminates when all relevant lines have been traversed.

## 📌 Key User Interactions

### 🚂 Selecting Maintenance Type

Users can choose between:
- Maintaining all railway lines
- Maintaining only electrified lines

The implementation filters the relevant lines based on this selection.

### 🚉 Starting Station Selection

1. The algorithm identifies valid starting stations based on graph theory:
    - For Eulerian circuits: Any station with relevant connections
    - For Eulerian paths: Only odd-degree stations

2. The system warns users if:
    - No maintenance route is possible
    - A specific station cannot be used as a starting point

### 🗺️ Route Visualization

In conjunction with GraphStream visualization:
- Shows stations and railway lines
- Highlights electrified lines with distinct colors
- Can display the complete maintenance route

## 🧪 Error Handling & Validation

The implementation handles multiple edge cases and provides specific warnings:

- **Disconnected subgraph warning**: "Warning - For the current network scenario, it is not possible to find a maintenance route..."
- **Invalid start station warning**: "Warning - For the current network scenario, a maintenance route is possible, but it must start at one station with an odd number of relevant lines."
- **Empty network handling**: Proper handling of empty or trivial graphs
- etc.
