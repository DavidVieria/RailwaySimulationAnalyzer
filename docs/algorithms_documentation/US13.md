# US13 – Connectivity Verification Based on Train Type

## 🎯 Objective

This user story ensures that the railway network supports proper connectivity checks between stations, depending on the **type of train** and **type of station**.  
The main functionalities include:

- Determining whether a path exists between two stations for a given train type.
- Checking full connectivity among subsets of stations (e.g., only `Stations` and `Terminals`).
- Understanding whether unreachability is due to lack of connection or train type limitations.
- Supporting structural analysis like Eulerian trails and transitive connectivity.

---

## ⚙️ Functionality Overview

### ✅ Key Capabilities Implemented:

- **Reachability check** between any two stations using Depth-First Search (DFS).
- **Electric-only path** validation by filtering non-electrified segments.
- **Transitive closure** matrix generation using Warshall’s algorithm.
- **Eulerian trail detection** to verify if a full maintenance route is feasible.
- **Support functions** to classify stations by type and load the network.

## 🧠 Implemented Algorithms

### 1. 🚂 Reachability DFS with Train Type Constraint

```java
private boolean dfs(int current, int target, Set<Integer> visited, String trainType) {
    if (current == target) return true;
    visited.add(current);

    for (Line l : graph.get(current)) {
        if (!visited.contains(l.to)) {
            if ("electric".equals(trainType) && !l.electrified) continue;
            if (dfs(l.to, target, visited, trainType)) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Purpose:**  
Determines whether a train (with possible restrictions like `electric`) can reach a destination from a source.

**Characteristics:**
- Recursive traversal.
- Skips non-electrified lines if the train is electric.
- Time complexity: `O(V + E)` in worst case (like standard DFS).

### 2. 🔎 Pure Topological DFS (ignoring train type)

```java
private boolean dfsIgnoreTrainType(int current, int target, Set<Integer> visited) {
    if (current == target) return true;
    visited.add(current);

    for (Line l : graph.get(current)) {
        if (!visited.contains(l.to)) {
            if (dfsIgnoreTrainType(l.to, target, visited)) return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```

**Purpose:**  
Checks pure connectivity between two stations, disregarding electrification.  
Useful for distinguishing whether an unreachability issue is **structural** or due to **train type constraints**.

---

### 3. 🔄 Transitive Closure (Warshall Algorithm)

```java
for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            reach[i][j] = reach[i][j] || (reach[i][k] && reach[k][j]);
        }
    }
}
```

**Purpose:**  
Computes whether **every node can reach every other node** in the graph using Boolean matrix operations.

**Use cases:**
- `isGraphConnectedUsingTransitiveClosure()`
- `printTransitiveClosureMatrix()`

**Time complexity:** `O(n³)`

---

### 4. ♻️ Eulerian Trail Detection (Optional for US14)

```java
    for (int node : graph.keySet()) {
        int count = 0;
        for (RailwayDataLoader.Line l : graph.get(node)) {
            if (!onlyElectrified || l.electrified) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        degree.put(node, count);
    }

    int odd = 0;
    for (int d : degree.values()) {
        if (d % 2 != 0) odd++;
    }
    return odd == 0 || odd == 2;
```

**Purpose:**  
Determines if there exists an **Eulerian trail** in the network (i.e., a path that visits every edge exactly once).  
Used to check feasibility of complete **maintenance routes**.

## 📄 Supporting Structures and Functions

### 🧩 Graph Representation

```
Map<Integer, List<Line>> graph
```
- **Undirected** adjacency list.
- Each line is added **bidirectionally** to reflect the two-way nature of railways.

### 🏷 Station Mapping

```
Map<String, Integer> nameToId;
Map<Integer, String> idToName;
Map<Integer, RailwayDataLoader.Station> stations;
```
- Stores mapping between station identifiers and internal numeric IDs.
- Keeps station type (`Depot`, `Station`, `Terminal`) for filtering.

### 🧮 Line Representation

```java
class Line {
    int from, to, length;
    boolean electrified;
}
```
- Represents a railway segment with its distance and electrification status.

## 📌 Notes

- All algorithms use **primitive control structures only** (loops, conditionals, maps/lists).
- No Java built-in pathfinding libraries (e.g., Dijkstra, A*) were used.
- **Graph visualization (GraphStream)** is **excluded** from this markdown as per Sprint 2 instructions.

---

## 🧪 Tests & Automatic Checks

- Electric reachability among Terminals only ✅
- Diesel connectivity among all stations ✅
- Electric reachability across mixed Station + Terminal ❌ if non-electrified segments exist
- Transitive matrix confirms full connection topologically

## 🗂 File Structure

- `loadStations(String file)` → Parses station names and types
- `loadLines(String file)` → Builds the network graph from file
- `checkReachabilityBetween(...)` → Validates reachability among station sets
