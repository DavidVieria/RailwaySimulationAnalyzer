## 🛤️ Project Overview

- Railway Simulation Analyzer is a Java application developed to simulate railway network scenarios and provide detailed analysis tools. The project was created to support university teaching of algorithms and data structures, enabling the practical application of theoretical concepts in real-world contexts.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Simulation of multiple railway scenarios from customizable input files (CSV).
- Generation and visualization of graphs (DOT format).
- Tools for path analysis, connections, and properties of railway graphs.
- Automated test coverage and detailed code documentation.
- Development organized by sprints, with task distribution and algorithm documentation.
